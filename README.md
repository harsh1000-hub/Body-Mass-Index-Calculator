1.) Flutter -> Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, Web platform, and the web from a single codebase. 

2.) Stateful Widgets: The widgets whose state can be altered once they are built are called stateful Widgets. These states are mutable and can be changed multiple times in their lifetime.
